## Setup for test

I used `yarn` instead of `npm`.
So, install yarn if needed (brew install yarn)

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
3. There is an `index.html` file, open it on a browser
3. Enjoy :)

ps : for this test I used Redux, just to show you a way of implementation.
Of course it's not really necessary for this test.
